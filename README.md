# SSTM-Edison-Python

I found a lot of the existing code for Intel Edison and Sparkfun Edison Blocks to be confusing. This repo attempts to provide simplified get-it-working python code for:

###### Sparkfun Edison Blocks 9DOF IMU
###### Sparkfun Edison Blocks ADC

None of these would happen without the community at large, so please see each file for license and credit.

I'm pretty new to GitHub, so please if you see a better way to do things, let me know.
